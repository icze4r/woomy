Find the Woomy and Veemo sound files. Easy to find: woomy.mp3 and veemo.mp3. Either change them into .ogg's or change the lines in HTML that refer to oggs, and you're good to go.

I like this and I want you to be able to play with it, but I can't risk losing a beloved domain name in order to host it. So, you can make it yourself and play wif it, if you want (◕ᴗ◕✿)
